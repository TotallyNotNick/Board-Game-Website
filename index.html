            <h2>Why This Website Exists</h2>
            <p>Board gaming as a hobby can look a little intimidating from the outside. There are thousands of titles,
                strange-sounding terms like “euro-game" or “worker-management,” and rules that might seem more
                complicated than
                they are.</p>
            <p>That’s where this website comes in. This site was built to ease you in — not overwhelm you with
                cardboard.</p>

            <h2>If You Love Video Games, You’ll Love These Too</h2>
            <p>If you’ve ever lost yourself in a story-rich RPG, battled through a strategy game, or built the perfect
                farm in
                Stardew Valley — board games offer a surprisingly similar kind of joy. Just... unplugged.</p>
            <p>Modern board games are often designed by the same types of minds that create your favorite video games —
                systems thinkers, artists, storytellers. And they offer something video games can’t always match:
                <b>face-to-face fun with real people</b>.

            <h2>A Brief History of Board Games</h2>
            <p>People have been playing board games for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians played Senet. The Chinese
                refined Go. Medieval nobles dueled in Chess.</p>
            <p>But in the 1990s, the hobby transformed. <i>Catan</i> — a German import — helped usher in a new wave of
                design
                that emphasized clever mechanics, strategy, and player interaction. Since then, thousands of games have
                emerged
                across every genre you can imagine.</p>
